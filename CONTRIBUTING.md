Welcome and thank you for your interest in contributing to the `ng-puzzle` project! Below are the guidelines to help you get started and make the most of your contributions.

### 1. Submitting Issues
- **Search for Existing Issues**: Before submitting a new issue, please search the existing issues to see if someone has already reported the same problem.
- **Describe the Issue**: If you find a new issue, please provide a detailed description of the background, steps to reproduce, and the expected behavior. Include any relevant error logs or screenshots.
- **Use Labels**: Please use appropriate labels for the type of issue, such as `bug`, `feature request`, etc.

### 2. Submitting Code (Pull Requests)
- **Fork the Project**: First, fork the project to your GitHub account.
- **Create a Branch**: From the `main` branch, create a new branch with a naming convention like `feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/your-fix-name`.
- **Write the Code**:
  - Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards.
  - Add necessary unit tests and integration tests.
  - Update the documentation to reflect your changes.
